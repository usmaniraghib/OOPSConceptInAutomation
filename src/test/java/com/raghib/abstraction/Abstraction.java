	 * As we know in java we can achieve abstraction using interface and abstract class.
	 * 
	 * Example;
	 * BaseClass.java
	 * 
	 * We can explain the abstraction usage in framework by taking the classic example of WebDriver interface.
	 * By explaining the driver creation method for different browsers and explaining how we are utilizing
	 * the browser classes.
	 * 
	 * WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
	 * WebDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();
	 *  
	 * and so on...
	 * 
	 * Where as WebDriver interface is only having method signatures in them.
